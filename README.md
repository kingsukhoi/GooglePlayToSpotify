# GooglePlayToSpotify

This is an application I made to convert the 100+ songs that I had in Google Play to Spotify.

Dependencies are:
- Google Chrome
- [Selenium Chrome Driver](http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) in the users path
- Python 3
- A GUI, cannot run Headless

To use, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Currently only Google Play To CSV works.

#TODO
- [x] Get Google Play songs to CSV
- [ ] Push CSV to Spotify
- [ ] Make 1 program to do all this
